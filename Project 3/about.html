                <p>Hi, my name is Max and I am a Shitzu/Poodle mix. I love taking very long walks and playing outside with my friends.
                   I enjoy any sort of dog friendly treat that you have to offer and I really enjoy snuggles. I
                   cannot wait for you to pick me so we can raise the woof together!

                <p>Hey there, my name is Stella and I am a Labradoodle. I may look like I am large in size, but I will
                   definetly attempt to fit on your lap. I have been going through a bit of a ruff pooch, so new friends
                   are always welcome!

                <p>My name is Lucy and the world revolves around me, so no pup-arazzi please. I am a Yorkshire Terrior
                    and Poodle mix. My favourite snacks are cheese and ham. I am very little in size but I have a very                   
                    big and loving heart. I may be sassy at times but I really do enjoy company, so a day with 
                    me would change your life.

                <p>If I were to be the cat version of a car I would be a Furr-ari because I 
                    am so energetic and quick! Peter Parker is my name and I love temptations treats and playing 
                    with lasers. Once I have had enough, I love taking long day-time naps in the sun.

                <p>Hello, my name is Teerian but you can call me Goober. A few of my favourite activities involve 
                   going outside to watch birds, hiding inside a pile of clothes or in a blanket. Lastly, my
                   favourite book is The Great Catsby!

                <p>Have I seen you before? You look furr-miliar. Anyways, my name is Sparkles and I may be a little
                   older than the other cats, but I offer a lot more love to give than both of them. I enjoy long naps,
                   playing with and unwinding yarn. My favourite activity is a good cuddle session!
